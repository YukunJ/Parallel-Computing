# Parallel Computing Spring 2020

This folder is for the course <Special Topic: Parallel Computing> at NYU Courant Spring 2020, when I was a junior undergrad student.

### Lab1 : MPI Language: C

   Purpose: 
   
               implement a parallel code to compute the number lying in range 2 to N 
               that is disivisible by a or b or c
               where N a b c is command line input provided by the user.

### Lab2 : OpenMP Language: C

   Purpose: 
   
               implement a parallel code to compute prime number lying between 2 to N
               using Sieve's algorithm. Essentially the key parallelable part is at the inner
               for loop.
